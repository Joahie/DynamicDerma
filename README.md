# DynamicDerma
A dermatology website that my friends and I made for Angelhacks (https://www.angelhacks.org/). The basic premise is that you upload an image of a skin disease, then the AI will detect what disease it is. It will then inform users about the skin condition they have and tell them where the nearest dermatologist is.
